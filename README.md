# Electronic Sales Analysis 📊👨🏻‍💻👨🏻‍🏫

Using Python **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** we will **Analyze** and Answer Business Questions about **12 Months** worth of Sales Data. 

The Data contains Hundreds of Thousands of Electronics Store Purchases broken down by Month, Product Type, Cost, Purchase Address, Product Quantity etc. 

We start by **Data Cleaning** :

- Drop NaN values from DataFrame.

- Removing Rows based on a condition.

- Change the type of Column containing Datetime (to_datetime)

Once Data is Cleaned we will **Explore** our Data. 

We will Explore 5 High Level **Business Oriented Questions** related to our Data:

- What was the Best Month for Sales ? How much was Earned that Month ?

- Which City sold the most Product ?

- What Time should we Display Advertisements or Provide Offers to Maximize the 

  Likelihood of Customer’s Buying Product by Attracting them ?

- What Products are most often Sold together ?

- What Product Sold the most ? Why it is Sold the Most ?

To Answer these Questions we walk through many different **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** methods. 

- **Concatenating** Multiple CSV Files together to Create a New DataFrame **(pd.concat)**

- Adding Columns.

- Parsing Cells as Strings to make New Columns **(.str)**.

- Applying Functions on Each Data Row Using the **.apply()** method.

- Using **Groupby** to perform **Aggregate Analysis**.

- Plotting **Bar charts** and **Line Graphs** to Visualize our Results.

- Labeling our Graphs.
